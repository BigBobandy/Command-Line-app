# Command Line app
A web application that allows users to execute command-line tools remotely on a server. Users can input commands through a interface, while the backend processes and returns the output. The app provides a list of commonly used commands for different operating systems. Note that in order to use the application, users must run it on their own machine by setting up a local development server. To do this, users can execute the command "node index.js" or the appropriate command for their project setup. Once the server is running, users can access the application's interface by opening their web browser and navigating to the server's address (e.g., http://localhost:3001 or the specified URL and port).
